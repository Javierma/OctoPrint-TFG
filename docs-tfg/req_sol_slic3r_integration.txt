Requirements to integrate Slic3r in order to achieve slicing using the terminal:

	-Integration of Slic3r as a plugin, so user can select whether to install it or not

	-Add Slic3r to plugins menu under settings 

	-If slic3r is selected to be installed, install automatically unless it already exists. If not possible, tell the user how to do it.

	-When Slic3r is installed and in case it is selected, in the settings windows should appear:
		-A box to introduce the path
		-A box to introduce each of the related profile files:
			-Print settings
			-Filament settings
			-Printer settings
		-A checkbox to ask the user if he wishes to maintain the stl file after slicing or not		

	-When slicing one or multiple objects, delete stl file if user chose that option in settings
